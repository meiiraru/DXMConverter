# DXM / DLM to OBJ Converter
* Drag and drop the DLM file onto the executable to convert it to an OBJ file
* The OBJ file will be saved in the same directory as the executable, in a subfolder with the same name as the DLM file
* Textures and MTL files will also be saved in the same directory as the OBJ

## Unpacking of DXM to DLM is not supported yet!!
